  ## Installation    
  This application is ran using Node.js, so the user will need that installed on their computer. To get the application running, clone this repo into the desired location, navigate there in the command terminal, run npm i to install the necessary npm libraries, and finally run node index.js.    
      
  ## Usage    
  When the repo is cloned, npm libraries are installed, and node index.js is ran, the user will be presented with a series of questions regarding how the logo will look. The logo accepts a string of three characters as text, a shape for the logo, a color for the shape, and a color for the text. Colors may be entered by their name (i.e. red, blue, green) or by hexidecimal number. Users may choose between triangle, square, and circle for the shape of their logo.
